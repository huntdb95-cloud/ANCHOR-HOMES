            <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; line-height: 1.5;">
              This document is a binding contract, which will serve as a blanket agreement for and
              between <strong>Anchors Homes LLC</strong>, herein known as
              <strong>Builder</strong>, and the undersigned, referred to hereafter as
              <strong>Subcontractor</strong>. By signing, Subcontractor and Builder agree to the
              terms set forth herein. This agreement shall remain in force from the date hereof and
              from year to year, unless a change is agreed to in writing by both Builder and
              Subcontractor.
            </p>

            <h3>1. General Performance</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              All work of the Subcontractor will be performed in a good and workmanlike manner in
              accordance with the plans and specifications for each job, and must comply with all
              Federal and State laws, codes, and regulations, and all county and/or municipal
              ordinances and regulations effective where the work is to be performed under this
              contract. All permits, fees, taxes, and expenses connected with such compliance are
              to be paid by the Subcontractor.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Independent Contractor</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              Builder and Subcontractor agree that the Subcontractor is being hired solely as an
              independent contractor, and that neither the Subcontractor nor Subcontractor’s
              employees shall be deemed to be employees of the Builder.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Time</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              Subcontractor agrees to promptly begin work as soon as notified by Builder, and to
              complete the work in a professional and workmanlike manner within a reasonable
              period once work is commenced, and in any event by the deadlines established by
              Builder in writing. Subcontractor shall cooperate with other trades so that each may
              reasonably complete their respective work within required time frames. Subcontractor
              shall provide competent supervision, sufficient skilled workers, and adequate
              materials to maintain Builder’s work schedule, and warrants that all required
              licenses and permits are in place. If Builder determines that Subcontractor’s work
              does not conform to the drawings, specifications, or quality standards, Builder may
              require correction; if Subcontractor does not correct such defects on Builder’s
              timetable, Builder may correct them and charge back the cost to Subcontractor.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Extras</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              No deviations from the work specified in the contract will be permitted or paid for
              unless a written extra work or change order is first agreed upon and signed as
              required.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Assignment</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              No assignment of this subcontract agreement by Subcontractor is permitted without
              prior written permission from Builder.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Hold Harmless</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              Subcontractor agrees to protect, defend, and indemnify Builder against, and hold
              Builder harmless from, any and all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, expenses,
              suits, and actions (including attorney’s fees) arising out of, or alleged to arise
              out of, the work covered by this subcontract, including injury, death, or property
              damage, even if attributable in part to negligence or other fault of Builder or its
              officers, agents, or employees, except to the extent it is determined that the injury,
              death, or damages were attributable solely to Builder’s fault or negligence. Builder
              may withhold from payments due such amounts as may be reasonably necessary to
              protect against such liability.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Mechanics Lien</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              Subcontractor shall furnish all partial and final lien waivers and sworn statements
              for Subcontractor and Subcontractor’s material suppliers as required by Builder, as a
              condition precedent to partial and final payments. If any lien, encumbrance, or claim
              for nonpayment is asserted against Builder’s property arising out of this contract,
              Subcontractor shall protect, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Builder from and
              against such liens and all related costs and expenses, and Builder may treat such
              assertion as a default and back charge Subcontractor.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Clean-Up</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              Subcontractor agrees to clean up all debris, trash, and refuse generated by
              Subcontractor’s trade at the end of each day and deposit it in the trash bin provided
              by Builder, leaving the job broom-clean for the next trade. Failure to comply after
              notice may result in Builder performing the clean-up and back charging Subcontractor.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Default</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              If Subcontractor defaults in the performance of any duties or obligations hereunder
              and such default continues after verbal or written notice, Builder may immediately
              terminate this Agreement. Subcontractor shall be due only such sums for approved work
              up to termination and shall furnish lien waivers upon termination and payment.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Care of Materials</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              Subcontractor agrees to properly care for materials supplied by Builder, store usable
              materials in an orderly way protected from damage, and properly dispose of non-usable
              materials. Builder may hold Subcontractor accountable and back charge for materials
              damaged by negligent care. Subcontractor shall promptly notify Builder of any defects
              in materials supplied by Builder.
            </p>

            <h3>11. Payment</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              Builder shall provide stated time frames for Subcontractor to submit invoices.
              Invoices not received by the stated time will be processed in the next pay period.
              Invoices in question may be held in their entirety until any disputed charge is
              resolved, and payment for a disputed charge may be held from Subcontractor’s total
              payment regardless of the specific project in dispute.
            </p>

            <h3>12. Insurance</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              Subcontractor shall provide Builder with a Certificate of Insurance showing required
              coverage in effect during the period of the contract, including Commercial General
              Liability, Workers’ Compensation (as applicable), and Automobile Liability with
              specified minimum limits, naming Builder as Additional Insured where required.
              Subcontractor agrees to notify Builder immediately of any changes, cancellation, or
              non-renewal of coverage.
            </p>

            <h3>Health and Safety</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              Subcontractor agrees to exercise all precautions necessary to prevent accidents and
              to comply with all applicable health and safety requirements, including OSHA and
              Tennessee OSHA. Subcontractor is responsible for any penalties for non-compliance by
              Subcontractor, its employees, or agents, and for proper handling and disposal of any
              hazardous materials.
            </p>

            <h3>13. Conduct</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              Subcontractor, its employees, and agents shall conduct themselves in a professional
              manner at all times. The use of, or being under the influence of, alcohol or drugs on
              the jobsite is prohibited. Subcontractor agrees that, in the event of any accident on
              the jobsite where Subcontractor personnel are present, such personnel may be required
              to submit to drug testing under Builder’s policy. Subcontractor further agrees not to
              enter into any agreement with Builder’s customer regarding the property while the
              house is under construction and until the customer has purchased the property.
            </p>

            <h3>14. Maintenance of Erosion Control</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              Subcontractor agrees not to disturb erosion control systems constructed on site on
              behalf of Builder. If silt fencing or other erosion control measures are moved for
              access, they shall be returned to effective status immediately. Subcontractor shall
              indemnify and hold harmless Builder from all claims, fines, damages, losses, and
              expenses arising from damage to erosion control structures caused by Subcontractor,
              its employees, or agents.
            </p>

            <h3>15. Arbitration</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; line-height: 1.6;">
              Any dispute respecting the provisions of this Agreement or the meaning of drawings or
              specifications shall be decided by binding arbitration as the sole remedy. Each party
              shall select one disinterested arbitrator, and those two shall select a third. The
              decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be binding, final, and conclusive.
              The expense of arbitration shall be borne equally by Builder and Subcontractor.
            </p>

            <h3>16. Warranty</h3>

              Subcontractor shall warrant against defects in workmanship and materials supplied by
              Subcontractor for a period of one year from the date the home is first occupied by
              the homeowner. The warranty shall be of the same standards and duration as Builder’s
              warranty to the Owner.
