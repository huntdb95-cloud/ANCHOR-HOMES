          <h2>Meet the Owner – Austin Bream</h2>
          <p>
            Anchor Homes LLC is led by <strong>Austin Bream</strong>, a
            Pennsylvania native with a decade of hands-on construction
            experience. Austin spent over ten years working in the field,
            learning the trades, understanding jobsite realities, and seeing
            firsthand what makes a project run smoothly—or fall behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before launching Anchor Homes LLC, Austin served for five years as
            head of construction for a large home builder. In that role he
            oversaw scheduling, quality control, trade coordination, and
            customer walk-throughs across a wide mix of projects. That
            experience built a deep understanding of how to deliver consistent
            craftsmanship while keeping budgets and timelines in check.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Anchor Homes LLC focuses on a simple foundation:
            <strong>integrity, clear communication, and taking care of the
            customer</strong>. That means accurate expectations up front,
            honest conversations when decisions need to be made, and a steady
            focus on the details that make a home feel solid for years to come.
          </p>
